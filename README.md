# PROJECT-Etch-A-Sketch

This Project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The goal is to create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

It is a simple project to practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Project Requirements

- [x] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
- [x] Create the divs using JavaScript
- [x] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [x] Add buttons that change the color of the grid squares, clear the grid.
- [x] Add a slider to resize the grid (e.g. from 16x16 to 64x64).

## Thoughts on the Project

This project was a good opportunity to practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I had to use a lot of CSS to make the grid look good and to make the buttons look like buttons. I also had to use a lot of JavaScript to create the grid, to change the color of the grid squares, to clear the grid and to resize the grid.

I had a lot of fun doing this project and I am happy with the result. I am looking forward to the next project.
